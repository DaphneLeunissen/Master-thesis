# Master-thesis
A Galaxy-based NGS pipeline for lung cancer diagnostics

The files within this repository belong to the research project performed during my master thesis. 
This research project was executed at the molecular pathology with the aim of creating a novel NGS pipeline 
for replacing/supporting the current commercial data analysis software. 

The R script Result_comp_thesis includes a script for the result comparison between the two pipelines.
This comparison is based on the genomic position of the variant.

The R script SNFtool_thesis includes a machine learning algorithm, SNF, for the subclassification based on 
clinical characteristics and mutation information of each subject. With the aim of finding biologically relevant clusters/
patterns within the dataset. 

The BED file, used during the creation of the Galaxy pipeline, is also included: specific_regions_smmips
